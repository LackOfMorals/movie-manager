# Chapter 1: Set Up Your Environment

In this chapter, you'll set up your development environment, create a React application from templated, and provision a GraphQL Data API for a Neo4j Aura instance. 


## Create Your React Application

First, create a new React application with TypeScript support using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest movie-manager -- --template react-ts
cd movie-manager
```

This creates a new directory called `movie-manager` with a basic React + TypeScript setup.  The template website will be running at http://localhost:5173.   Press CTRL+C to stop the website running.

## Install Required Dependencies

Install the packages you'll need for this tutorial.  Make sure you are in the ```movie-manager``` folder and then. 

```bash
cd movie-manager
npm install
npm install graphql-request graphql
npm install @tanstack/react-query
npm install -D @tanstack/react-query-devtools
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

These packages provide:
- **graphql-request**: A lightweight GraphQL client for making requests
- **graphql**: Core GraphQL functionality
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Powerful data fetching and caching
- **@tanstack/react-query-devtools**: Development tools for debugging queries
- **tailwindcss**:  Styling for our application using the popular tailwind package

## Set Up Your Neo4j Database

### Load the Movies Dataset

1. Log in to your [Neo4j Aura Console](https://console.neo4j.io/)
2. Open your database instance
3. Select "Connect" and then "Query" to open the Neo4j Browser
4. When the  Welcome message is shown, select "Try Neo4j with the Movie Graph"
5. Follow the instructions on "Step 2 Create the data". There are several Cypher statements shown.  At the top of those, there is a arrow head in a circle. Select that to create the Movie graph in your database.


### Enable DataAPI GraphQL

1. In the Aura Console, under Data services, select "Data APIs"
2. Click on the "Create API"
3. Complete the form as follows
	- API Name: MovieGraphQL
	- Instance: <The name of your Neo4j instance with the Movie Graph>
	- Instance permissions: Choose "Read & Write"
	- Select "Enable introspection"
	- Type defintions:  Copy and paste the following

```typescript
type ActedInProperties @relationshipProperties {
    roles: [String!]!
}

type Movie @node {
    peopleActedIn: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: IN, properties: "ActedInProperties")
    peopleDirected: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "DIRECTED", direction: IN)
    peopleProduced: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "PRODUCED", direction: IN)
    peopleReviewed: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "REVIEWED", direction: IN, properties: "ReviewedProperties")
    peopleWrote: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "WROTE", direction: IN)
    released: Int!
    tagline: String
    title: String!
}

type Person @node {
    actedInMovies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "ACTED_IN", direction: OUT, properties: "ActedInProperties")
    born: Int
    directedMovies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "DIRECTED", direction: OUT)
    followsPeople: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "FOLLOWS", direction: OUT)
    name: String!
    peopleFollows: [Person!]! @relationship(type: "FOLLOWS", direction: IN)
    producedMovies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "PRODUCED", direction: OUT)
    reviewedMovies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "REVIEWED", direction: OUT, properties: "ReviewedProperties")
    wroteMovies: [Movie!]! @relationship(type: "WROTE", direction: OUT)
}

type ReviewedProperties @relationshipProperties {
    rating: Int!
    summary: String!
}
```

-
	- Select "Add allowed origin" and enter http://localhost:5173.  This is the address the Movie Management website uses.
	- Under Authentication Providers, select "Add authentication provider".  
	- Make sure Type is set to "API Key" and enter a name of "MovieGraphQLKey".  This will control access. 
	- Select "Create"
4. Select "Download and continue" to download connnection information to a local text file. 
5. The creation process will take a few minutes. 



## Configure Your Application

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your Neo4j DataAPI GraphQL endpoint information, found in the download file, to `.env`:

```env
VITE_NEO4J_GRAPHQL_URL=YOUR_DATA_API_URL
VITE_NEO4J_GRAPHQL_TOKEN=YOUR_DATA_API_AUTH_PROVIDER_API_KEY
```

>  **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in the `.gitignore` file created by Vite.

## Test connectivity

Using CURL you can quickly check that the DataAPI is working.  Enter the following into a command prompt, changing YOUR_DATA_API_URL and YOUR_DATA_API_AUTH_PROVIDER_API_KEY to match your values

```bash
curl --location YOUR_DATA_API_URL\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: YOUR_DATA_API_AUTH_PROVIDER_API_KEY' \
  --data '{"query": "query GetMovies { movies { title }}"}'
```

This GraphQL query lists all movies with their title. 


If everything works, you're ready to move on to the next chapter!
